/*
1) Find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 500. 

 

WTD: Examine an array expected to contain consecutive integers from 1 to 500. Identify any integer that is missing from this sequence. 

 

(e.g.: I/P: [1,2,4,5]; O/P: 3) 
*/

/*
Thoughts:
- Array Should be within the range 1 to 500. 
- Sort the array, if not already sorted.
- Check if the array elements are consecutive.
- Have 2 options, 1 - Auto Generated array. 2 - User Input.
